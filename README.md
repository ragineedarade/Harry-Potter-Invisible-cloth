 # Harry Potter Invisibility Cloak 🧥✨

Welcome to the **Invisibility Cloak Project**, inspired by the magical world of *Harry Potter*! This project aims to replicate the invisibility effect using **computer vision** and **background subtraction techniques**.

## 📌 Features
- **Real-time Cloak Effect** 🪄: Hide objects or people using color masking.
- **OpenCV & Python** 🐍: Implemented using OpenCV for image processing.
- **Customizable Background** 🎭: Change the backdrop for a seamless effect.
- **Easy to Use** 🎉: Just run the script and experience invisibility!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Capture the initial background frame.
2. Detect a specific cloak color (e.g., red, blue, or green).
3. Replace the detected cloak area with the background.
4. Display the real-time effect using OpenCV.

## 📥 Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/invisibility-cloak.git
   cd invisibility-cloak
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python cloak.py
   ```

## 🛑 How to Stop the Script
To stop the invisibility cloak effect, simply **press** `Q` on your keyboard while the OpenCV window is open, or close the window manually.

Alternatively, if running in a terminal, use:
```bash
CTRL + C
```
This will terminate the script immediately.
